# Ethics & data governance

## MVP phase
- Uses public datasets only (SRA/ENA)
- No patient-identifiable information is collected or stored

## Future clinical phases
- Any hospital data must be anonymized/pseudonymized
- Access control by roles (clinician/researcher/admin)
- Data use under local ethical approval and agreements (MoU/DTA)
